# Telcom Analysis
    • User Overview analysis
    • User Engagement analysis
    • User Experience analysis
    • User Satisfaction Analysis Project

## Overview
The **Telcom Analysis** outlined focus on comprehensive data analysis of telecom users' behavior, engagement, experience, and satisfaction. Task 1 involves conducting a User Overview analysis, identifying handset usage trends, and aggregating xDR session data for various applications. Task 2 focuses on User Engagement Analysis, where engagement metrics are aggregated and normalized, followed by k-means clustering and insights on user activity per application. Task 3 dives into Experience Analytics, analyzing network performance metrics and handset characteristics, and performing k-means clustering to segment users based on experience. Task 4 analyzes customer satisfaction by combining engagement and experience scores, building a regression model, running additional clustering, and exporting the final data for database integration. The tasks conclude with model deployment tracking using tools like Docker or MLFlow to monitor and document the model's performance. These tasks aim to enhance telecom services by providing data-driven insights into customer behavior, satisfaction, and experience.
