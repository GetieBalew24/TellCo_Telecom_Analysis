## Analysis Tasks

### Task 1: User Overview Analysis

- **Top 10 Handsets**: Identify the most popular devices among users.
- **Top 3 Manufacturers**: Determine the leading handset manufacturers.
- **Session Duration and Data Usage**: Explore patterns in how users interact with their devices.

### Task 2: User Engagement Analysis

- **Engagement Metrics**: Calculate session frequency, duration, and total traffic to assess user engagement.
- **High Engagement Users**: Identify users with the highest engagement levels.

### Task 3:User Experience Analytics in the Telecommunication Industry
#### Tasks Overview
- **Task 3.1: Aggregate Information per Customer**:Calculate average TCP retransmission, average RTT, average throughput, and identify the handset type for each customer. Handle missing values and outliers by replacing them with the mean (for numeric data) or the mode (for categorical data).
- **Task 3.2: Compute and List 10 of the Top, Bottom, and Most Frequent Values**:Identify the top, bottom, and most frequent values for TCP, RTT, and throughput in the dataset.
- **Task 3.3: Distribution and Average Analysis per Handset Type**:Report the distribution of average throughput and the average TCP retransmission per handset type and provide interpretations based on the findings.
- **Task 3.4: K-Means Clustering**:Perform k-means clustering (with k = 3) on the aggregated experience metrics to segment users into groups of experiences. Provide a brief description of each cluster based on the data.

### Task 4: Customer Satisfaction Analysis and Model Deployment
#### Tasks Overview:
- **Task 4.1: Calculate engagement and experience scores using Euclidean distance.**
- **Task 4.2: Compute the satisfaction score by averaging engagement and experience scores.**
- **Task 4.3: Build a regression model to predict customer satisfaction.**
- **Task 4.4: Perform k-means clustering (k=2) on the scores.**
- **Task 4.5: Aggregate average satisfaction and experience scores per cluster.**
- **Task 4.6: Export the results to MySQL and provide a select query screenshot.**
- **Task 4.7: Deploy the model and track changes using MLFlow or Docker.**

### Task 5: Dashboard Development for Data Insights
#### Tasks Overview: Design and Development:

***Create a dashboard*** with separate pages for each task title (e.g., User Overview Analysis, User Engagement Analysis, Experience Analysis, Satisfaction Analysis).Visualize the relevant data for each task using appropriate plots.

#### KPIs:

- **Dashboard Usability**: Ensure the dashboard is easy to use with intuitive navigation and clear labels.
- **Interactive Elements**: Incorporate effective use of widgets (e.g., dropdowns, sliders) to enhance user engagement.
- **Visual Appeal**: Design the dashboard to be clean, professional, and visually appealing, ensuring it effectively communicates the data insights.
- **Deployment Success**: Ensure the dashboard is fully functional and accessible via a public URL.
